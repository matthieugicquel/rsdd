## What is it for real?

</p>

A very simple VS Code extension that shows the number of "squiggles" (errors or warnings) you get while coding.

It's a joke, but it's also a real extension that you can install and use.

You'll get a status bar item that shows the **average number of squiggles per save**.

It will update on each save, and reset when you close the VS Code.
